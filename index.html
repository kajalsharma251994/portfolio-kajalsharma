  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <article class="project">
    <h3>Big Data - GutMeal Project - AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition</h3>
       <div class="project-objective">
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>The core objective is to create a functional and optimized machine learning solution that bridges the gap between individual biological data (gut microbiome) and actionable health interventions (personalized meal plans).</p>
    
    <h4>Specific Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Develop a Predictive ML Model:</strong> Design and train a scalable machine learning model (using PySpark and Spark MLlib) that accurately predicts personalized meal plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrate Diverse Data:</strong> Base these predictions on a comprehensive set of features, including gut microbiome profile, detailed dietary intake, demographic data (age, gender, BMI), and food allergy data.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize for Big Data:</strong> Ensure the model and system architecture are scalable and optimized for handling large datasets (implied by the use of PySpark and Spark MLlib).</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure Clinical Relevance and Interpretability:</strong> Produce interpretable visualizations and clinically relevant outcomes that can aid in improving metabolic, digestive, and inflammatory conditions through personalized nutrition.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Tools and Programming Language</h4>
    <p>PySpark, Machine Learning models, Python, TensorFlow</p>

    <h3>Data Analytics Project - State of the Region (SOR) Project</h3>
       <div class="project-objective">
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>The project focuses on automating data workflows and building insights platforms around regional socio-economic indicators. This year, the scope includes automating data collection and cleaning, database design, website development, and interactive dashboard creation. Data sources include both traditional (e.g., Census) and real-time (e.g., Google Trends, Social Media) APIs.</p>
    
    <h4>Specific Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytical Goal:</strong> To analyze and visualize poverty rate trends (2012-2023) using U.S. Census data to identify geographic patterns, temporal changes, and socioeconomic disparities across Florida counties.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Goal:</strong> To automate data workflows (collection and cleaning via APIs) and design an insights platform (database design, website development, and interactive dashboard creation) optimized for regional socio-economic indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>Actionable Goal:</strong> To create an accessible knowledge base that enables policymakers and community organizations to understand poverty distribution, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and make informed decisions about targeted resource allocation and poverty reduction strategies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Tools and Programming Language</h4>
    <p>Tableau, Python,REST APIs (Specifically the U.S. Census API)</p>
